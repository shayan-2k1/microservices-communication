This microservice project is designed as a comprehensive exploration of modern interservice communication technologies, with a focus on practical implementation and architectural comparison. The primary objective is to evaluate and demonstrate how different messaging and communication protocols—<strong>RabbitMQ</strong>, <strong>Apache Kafka</strong>, and <strong>gRPC</strong>—can be integrated within a distributed system to enable efficient, scalable, and reliable service-to-service interactions.

The project is structured to include multiple microservices that interact using distinct communication patterns such as:

- <strong>Message Queuing with RabbitMQ</strong>: Showcasing asynchronous communication and decoupling of services via a robust message broker.
- <strong>Event Streaming with Apache Kafka</strong>: Demonstrating high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data pipelines through event-driven architecture.
- <strong>Remote Procedure Calls with gRPC</strong>: Illustrating high-performance synchronous communication using protocol buffers for strongly-typed, contract-first APIs.

This setup enables comparative analysis of each technology in terms of performance, complexity, reliability, and suitability for various use cases. It is ideal for developers and architects seeking practical insights into microservice communication strategies and looking to make informed decisions when designing distributed systems.

The repository includes documentation for comprehensive analysis for each use-case.
